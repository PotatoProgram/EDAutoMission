# EDAutoMission
Automatically accepts missions of a type
(This is a work in progress so expect bugs)

## Installation
Currently, there are no builds available.

For development/testing purposes:
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone the repo
4. [Install Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdoc/blob/main/Installation.md)
    - It is recommended to install to the default path (C:/Program Files/Tesseract) however, if installing to a different drive ensure that you install directly to the drive, i.e. to `D:/Tesseract` (where `D:` is the drive you are installing Tesseract to)
3. Install requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## How to use:
1. Dock and click starport services
2. Make sure mission board is selected (see image, below)
3. Tab over to your terminal
4. Start program (`python main_ody.py`)
5. Tab back to the game within 5 seconds
